## 🎓 Professional Mindset

**Six Core Principles guiding technical decisions:**

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔄 **Reliability-Oriented** | Every decision considers equipment lifespan, failure risk, operational continuity. Preventive > reactive. |
| 🔍 **Root Cause Awareness** | Dig deeper to understand *why* systems fail, not just *what* failed. Prevent recurrence. |
| ⚠️ **Safety as Baseline** | Industrial work = real risk. Electrical hazards, confined spaces demand discipline. Non-negotiable. |
| 📈 **Continuous Improvement** | Every maintenance cycle refines process, documentation, execution. Incremental gains compound. |
| 📢 **Clear Communication** | Document thoroughly. Explain findings in practical, actionable terms for all stakeholders. |
| ✏️ **Precision & Discipline** | Accurate measurements, careful procedures, proper documentation = equipment reliability. Details matter. |
